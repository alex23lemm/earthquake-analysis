# Analysis of earthquake activity in 2014 around Darmstadt, Germany

## Synopysis

In 2014 several earthquakes struck the region east of Darmstadt (Germany). In this report we will use the earthquake data provided by the [Bundesanstalt fuer Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR)][BGR] and the `ggmap` package to create different maps. 

_Note:_ This analysis was inspired by [Bob's (Rudis) blog post][bob] about  the series of earthquakes which hit California in March 2014.
